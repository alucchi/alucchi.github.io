## About Me

I am currently an assistant professor in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Basel, Switzerland. Prior to this, I was a researcher at ETH Zürich’s Institute of Machine Learning. I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from EPFL in Lausanne. My work focuses on the theoretical foundations of deep learning, stochastic optimization, and practical machine learning applications, particularly in fine-tuning and reasoning.
